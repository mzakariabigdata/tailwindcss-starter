# TailwindCSS Starter

Easily bootstrap a new TailwindCSS project with this Makefile driven setup.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.
2. Clone this repository or use it as a template on GitHub.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run `make tailwindcss-starter` to set up a new TailwindCSS project.

### Specifying a Project Name

If you wish to specify a custom name for your project, you can do so using the `PROJECT_NAME` argument. For example:

```
make tailwindcss-starter PROJECT_NAME=CARD
```

This will initialize the project with the name "CARD" instead of the default "project-template".
